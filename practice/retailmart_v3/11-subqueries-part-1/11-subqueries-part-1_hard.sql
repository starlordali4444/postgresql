   SQL PRACTICE SET - Subqueries Part 1 (HARD LEVEL)
   Curriculum:   RetailMart V3
   Topic:        Subqueries - performance, rewrite, anti-patterns
   Database:     RetailMart V3

   Scope (HARD):
     - Rewrite slow subqueries as JOINs
     - Detect N+1 patterns
     - Planner forensics for subqueries
     - Anti-pattern catalog
     - Semi-join vs anti-join planner decisions
     - Subquery + index interaction

   Structure: 25 Rewrites + 25 Performance + 25 Anti-patterns + 25 Real-world
