   Topic:        Subqueries Part 1 - scalar, IN, EXISTS, ANY/ALL
   Database:     RetailMart V3

   Scope:
     - Scalar subqueries (in SELECT, WHERE)
     - IN (subquery) / NOT IN
     - EXISTS / NOT EXISTS
     - ANY / SOME / ALL
     - Single-value subqueries
     - Subquery placement (FROM/SELECT/WHERE/HAVING)

   Structure: 25 Conceptual + 25 IN/EXISTS + 25 ANY/ALL + 25 Scalar subqueries

/* ============================================================
   SECTION A: SUBQUERIES - CONCEPTUAL (25)
   ------------------------------------------------------------ */
/* Q1.  What is a subquery - and how is it different from a CTE? */
/* Q2.  What does "scalar subquery" mean - single row + single column. */
/* Q3.  Compare IN (subquery) vs EXISTS (subquery). */
/* Q4.  Why does NOT IN break when the subquery returns NULL? */
/* Q5.  What is a "correlated subquery"? */
/* Q6.  Compare = ANY(subquery) vs IN (subquery). */
/* Q7.  Compare > ALL(subquery) vs > (SELECT MAX...). */
/* Q8.  Can a subquery in SELECT return multiple rows? */
/* Q9.  Can a subquery in WHERE return multiple rows? */
/* Q10. Compare WHERE col = (subquery) vs WHERE col IN (subquery). */
/* Q11. What does (SELECT MAX(net_total) FROM ...) return - type? */
/* Q12. When is a subquery in FROM (derived table) required? */
/* Q13. Why must a subquery in FROM have an alias? */
/* Q14. Compare scalar subquery in SELECT vs JOIN - same result, different style. */
/* Q15. What is "semi-join" - and how does EXISTS implement it? */
/* Q16. What is "anti-join" - and how does NOT EXISTS implement it? */
/* Q17. Why does NOT EXISTS NOT have the NULL problem of NOT IN? */
/* Q18. Compare HAVING subquery vs WHERE subquery. */
/* Q19. Can a subquery reference its outer query's columns? (Yes if correlated.) */
/* Q20. Compare correlated subquery vs LEFT JOIN. */
/* Q21. Performance: when does the planner rewrite a subquery to a join? */
/* Q22. What is the "subquery cache" in some engines (not in Postgres). */
/* Q23. Compare uncorrelated subquery (executes once) vs correlated (executes per row). */
/* Q24. Why is "subquery returns more than one row" a common error? */
/* Q25. Compare subquery in SELECT vs subquery in WHERE for performance. */
